# Girvan-Newman-algorithm-for-data-mining
This project is the Girvan-Newman algorithm implementation. 
It is aim to detect community.

I use the algorithm code in https://github.com/sikasjc/CommunityDetection.

I will read the personal file and compute the result. And try to display them in graph.

I fix the bug for the source code. It will throw error when the original net is not fully connected.

Also I find this GN algorithm is too slow. So I write some R code to inpliment the same method.
